Installing the tsio package is very simple.

    Download the zip or tbz file into a directory of your choice.

    Extract the zip or tbz file.

    If you have scons available just enter
        scons

    If you don't have scoms available, there i a little more work:
       - compile the tsio,cpp file int an object filer.
       - create a library containing this file
       - If you want the test programming the compile the tsioTest.cpp file into
         an executable, adding the library you just created.

    Now you are all set to go.

Using the tsio package in your programs.

    Add '#include <tsio>' in your code where needed.

    Add the directory where you downloaded tsio as an include directory.

    Add the tsio library to the link command.
